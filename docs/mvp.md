MVP:

The tool generates a single random NPC every time it is run (a).

The user may choose from a selection of homebrew options that they wish to use when generating NPCs (b).

PCs have the following attributes: Name, Race, Background (if using the optional Background rules), Rituals or Techniques (if using the optional Technique rules), Stats (Defenses, hitpoints, etc.), Personality Traits, Powers (g).

Aside:

In particular, we are not concerned with the NPC generation method, adding new homebrew options, or generating anything other than NPCs for the MVP. In effect, this implementation might only include NPCs generated from a pre-set list, pre-selected Homebrew options, etc., though the program should be structured such that it is agnostic to the implementation details of these features for easy portability.
