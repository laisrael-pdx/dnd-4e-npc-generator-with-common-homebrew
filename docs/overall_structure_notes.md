The program should be highly modular, and each generation step should be agnostic to the implementation details. For example, the file that stitches together the NPC(s) or monster(s) after generation should simply call a function to generate the race, name, etc., for each creature one attribute at a time. That way, the actual means of generating any one attribute can change irrespective of any other attribute.
