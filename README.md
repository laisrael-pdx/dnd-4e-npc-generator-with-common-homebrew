# dnd-4e-npc-generator-with-common-homebrew

The application will generate random NPCs using Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition rules and commonly-added homebrew not available in other applications, for use by game masters.

The application uses Python. There are several reasons for this:
  
  a) Computation efficiency is not expected to be a bottleneck for this project, so Python’s efficiency limitations are not anticipated to be a concern.
    
  b) The application is intended to be adapted and modified by users with some technical knowledge and specific needs for their own gaming table. As Python is a commonly understood language and is especially readable, using it to write this application helps these users modify the application for their specific needs.
    
  c) Similar to point (b), Python allows for quicker development cycles and faster iteration due to the language’s ease of use. As there are a vast number of potential features to add and approximately two months to add them, this more rapid development time will allow for the scope of the application to be larger than otherwise permitted by, for example, strongly typed or compiled languages.
